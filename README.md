# SEGREGATION

**All About App**
"SEGREGATION" is a mobile application that was honored as one of the winning projects at WWDC2022.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Thailand initiated campaigns promoting waste segregation, particularly at the household level. The primary goal was to reduce waste accumulation through recycling, resulting in cost savings for waste management, reduced energy and resource consumption, and environmental preservation. However, the main challenge lies in achieving effective and proper waste segregation, as improper and inefficient practices could undermine the potential benefits and may place an increased burden on waste disposal staff.

These challenges served as inspiration for me to design and develop an application that assists Thai individuals to effortlessly and correctly segregate waste, all while fostering greater confidence in the household-level waste segregation.

**Features and functionality**
1. Seamlessly segregate waste into five distinct categories: Green (Biodegradable Waste), Blue (Non-Biodegradable Waste), Yellow (Recyclable Waste), Red (Toxic Waste), and Grey (Infectious Waste) using either the default list or your customized waste inventory.
2. Easily add and update your personal waste items, including Waste Picture, Name, and Category.

"SEGREGATION" has been developed and designed with a strong focus on usability principles, ensuring an excellent user experience for individuals of all ages. You have an alternative to add and update your own waste items, complete with their respective attributes, or simply use the default list provided at the outset. In the waste list section, you can conveniently select multiple waste items you have on hand, and the application will provide you with the best results for waste segregation.

Sincerely hope that this app will serve as a source of inspiration for you, encouraging you to pay more attention to waste segregation and enabling you to separate waste more effectively. Ultimately, I believe this can contribute to a more beautiful world.
